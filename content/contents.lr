body:

getdns is a modern asynchronous DNS API. It implements DNS entry points from a design developed and vetted by application developers, in an [API specification](/spec/) originally edited by Paul Hoffman. The open source C implementation of getdns is developed and maintained in collaboration by NLnet Labs, Sinodun and No Mountain Software. This implementation is licensed under the [New BSD License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

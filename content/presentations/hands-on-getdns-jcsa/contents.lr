abstract:

This tutorial gives an overview of the getdns API: a modern, application-friendly interface that can be used by app developers to more easily query arbitrary data in the DNS without the need to be DNS protocol experts.

We will show concrete programming examples using getdns, including an open-source library implementation of the API in several languages: Python, Javascript and C.

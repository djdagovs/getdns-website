announcement:

Verisign and NLnet Labs are pleased to announce the first beta release (0.1.0) of an open source implementation of the getdns API specification.
The project's home page is at <https://getdnsapi.net>.

getdns is a modern asynchronous DNS API.
It implements DNS entry points from a design developed and vetted by application developers, in the specification at [`http://www.vpnc.org/getdns-api/`](http://web.archive.org/web/20140628135056/http://www.vpnc.org/getdns-api/) edited by Paul Hoffman.
With the development of this API, we intend to offer application developers a modernized and flexible way to access DNS security (DNSSEC) and other powerful new DNS features; a particular hope is to inspire application developers towards innovative security solutions in their applications.

We invite everyone to take a look at the project and to provide feedback to us and even contribute back to the project!
We expect to have successive releases over the next few months that move us toward a more complete implementation and includes ports to even more platforms.
